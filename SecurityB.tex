\item Security

\begin{itemize}


\item Test results:
- There were only two things that needed catering for security, firstly authentication against a chosen user repository (the LDAP Computer Science Department of the University of Pretoria) and secondly a flexible, configurable authorization framework allowing administrators to configure the access to any particular service based on the user role and other factors like the user status. These were never integrated into the system, they were partially implemented.

- At the current state the system provides user authentication, and everything else was not catered for. A distinct system admin should have been created to monitor security measures and the authorization framework. \\
