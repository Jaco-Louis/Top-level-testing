\item Maintainability:

The Buzz(B) system is maintainable in the following aspects:

\begin{itemize}
\item Understandable by future developers:

Every subsystem or 'module' of the system is implemented as a seperate functioning module.
Standalone modules are then plugged into the system.
New developers can change modules independantly.
\item Technologies used is current and expected to be available for a long time:

Node.js makes up the core of the buzz system. It is a widely used open-source platform released in Q1 of 2009. Popularity has grown tremendously and is not expected to stop growing in the near future. 

MongoDB is used as a database structure of the Buzz system and is highly compatible with Node.js. Also released in 2009 and is now the fourth most popular type of database management system.  MongoDB is expected to grow even more in the coming years which makes it   a good choice for the Buzz system in terms of maintainability.

\item The system is easily updated

New functionality can be added by adding modules to the system.
Functionality can be changed by changing independat modules without having to rebuild the whole system.
