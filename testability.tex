\item Testability:

\textbf{Description}

A system needs testable through:
\begin{itemize}
\item Unit testing components in isolation
\item Integration tests where the components are integrated to the actual environment
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Test Results}
   
The Buzz system is divided into manageable components (modules) for each use case. Breaking the system into these components makes the system testable through unit testing using mock objects. The Buzz system is a modular system, the system components are pluggable and makes automated integration testing simple as the components are integrated into the entire system.
