\item Testability:

\textbf{Description}

A system needs testabl through:
\begin{itemize}
\item Unit testing components in isolation
\item Integration tests where the components are integrated to the actual environment
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Test Results}
   
The Buzz system is divided into manageable components (modules) for each use case. Breaking the system into these components makes make the system testable through unit testing using mock objects. The Buzz system is a modular system, the system components are pluggable and makes automated integration testing simple as the component is integrated in the entire system.
