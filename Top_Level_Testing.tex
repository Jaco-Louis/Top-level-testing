\section{Introduction}
This document contains the findings of the various activities performed as per testing of the Buzz Space system top level integration.

\section{Testing Results}
\subsection{Top Level A Testing Results}
\subsubsection{Functional Testing}
\subsubsection{Non-functional Testing} 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Usability:

The system is usable because firstly the necessary actions that a user can take appear in a navigation bar at the top of the screen. Thus it is easy for a novice user to be able to know what to click on and navigate the website. 

The interface is not cluttered, and only basic functionality is displayed on the home screen, making the system more learnable. The buttons are labelled with text rather than with graphical icons, and the text on the button is quite explanatory, which makes their purpose more clear. 

Larger headings are used to label the different sections, for example under the Manage Constraints tab there are large headings to indicate the Existing constraints section and the Add new constraint section. This again contributes to ease of use for the novice first year user.

Through these mechanisms the system is memborable hence it is also be understandable.  

\item Integratibility:

The system is able to address future integration requirements by providing access to its services using widely adopted public standards such as firstly having separate npm packages for all the different modules. The packages are stored on Synopia. Also, electrolyte is being used in the server to provide a dependency injection. The HandleBars server is the main server that needs to be used to test and integrate all the modules on. The routes/index.js, routes/infrastructure.js and routes/content.js files use express to route the different hbs files for the different modules in order to integrate the infrastructure and content subsystems into the main system. 

A separate file is used to establish the connection to the database to avoid having this done in all the separate files. Also, global variables are now used such as the global password and username for example. 

A document has been provided via email and a README file has been provided to specify important standards and regulations that must be followed.

The functional code in the separate packages must be placed in an exportable function taking parameters such as the database or settings, and this is done as part of the electrolyte dependency injection. 

Exports are also used in the different files to make the code accessible to the other files.

\item Deployability:

The system is deployable on Linux servers as we have run it using Ubuntu 14.04 Linux and the system was able to run. The following screenshot shows the system running on a Linux server:

The system is deployable on an environment using different databases for persistence of the Buzz database because the Handlebars server contains a folder called node\_modules, and it contains the buzz\_database package. This package can easily be swapped out and an alternative database package can be plugged in, that the system can use due to the flexibility of this server. As long as the new package has the same name so that the files that require the database do not need to be changed, no major changes will need to be made.

The system is deployable in environments where the user authentication credentials and roles are sourced from different repositories. The following screenshot indicates that the Handlebars server contains a folder called node\_modules, and it contains the buzz\_csds package. 
//screenshot

This package can easily be swapped out and an alternative data source package with different credentials and roles can be used, due to the pluggability of the system and dependency injection employed by the top level team. The new package must just be named the same as the old one to avoid errors where the file is required from the package in the code.
