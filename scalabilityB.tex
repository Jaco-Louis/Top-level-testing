\item Scalability

The Buzz(B) system is partially scalable in the following aspects:

\begin{itemize}
\item Able to host buzz spaces for all Computer Science modules:

The Buzz(B) system failed this scalability test. It does not support functionality of adding a new buzz space thus cannot host buzz spaces fot all CS modules.

\item University-wide, servicing in the order of 50 000 students:

The Buzz(B) system failed this scalability test. It does not support functionality of adding a new user or student. Thus one default user exists as apposed to 50 000.
\end{itemize}
