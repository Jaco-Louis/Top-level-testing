Security

The system is not secure in all areas. It requires a username and password in order for a user to login. The system successfully performs authentication against the LDAP repository. It does not allow users without the necessary authorisation to delete buzz spaces, but anyone can create a buzz space whether they are logged in or not. Only authorised users can add or remove admins. The system is also somewhat configurable, MIME types can be added, edited, and removed, but the system does not take authorisation level or whether a user is logged in into account for these actions, anyone can perform these actions. Admin users cannot configure access to certain services.

The log in user interface:

Determine if the user is authorised to close the buzz space:

Assign an admin to a BuzzSpace:

Auditability

The system is auditable. 
The system keeps a log of all the requests and responses. The requests does not have an id, but it does have a user id, a date/time stamp, it includes the request that was made, and it does not store any sensitive information.

For the responses, there is not an id for the log entry or a corresponding request entry, there is a date/time stamp, and there is no sensitive information included. Because the response entries does not have a way of indicating to which request it responded it can be difficult to make sense of the date or to trace errors.

The audit log can be accessed by humans and the system.

An example of responses that are logged:
A buzzSpace does not exist:
//buzzNotExistLog.png

Could not find space to remove:
//couldNotFindSpaceLog.png

Request to manage space COS9:
//manageSpaceLog.png

Response that states a space was closed successfully:
//ClosedSpaceLog.png


Testability

Only some modules included unit tests. For example, threads and spaces:
Unit testing for threads:
//unit_tests.png

Integration tests are also performed in some instances. 

In this instance authorisation is checked outside of the module that is was created in.
//integration.png

For both the user tests and the integration tests it is verified that all the pre-conditions are met 

The system is thus only testable in some cases, but there is a lot of potential to add further test cases as the system is set up in such a way that makes testing more convenient.
