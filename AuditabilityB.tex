\item Auditability

\begin{itemize}

\item Test results:
- As per system requirements, system will log all requests and all responses (including exceptions) for all user services provided by the system. The system will provide only services to extract information from the audit log and will not allow the audit log to be modified. Audit logs will be directly accessible to both, humans and systems.

- The current system provides none of the above mentioned, making auditability almost impossible. A simple log file (eg a text file) could be created to store all requires requests and responses. Humans will completely have no access to log files at the current state of the system. \\
