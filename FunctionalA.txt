appraisal tab on the menu bar, where an option exists to add an appraisal type. The various options that exist, regarding this, is adding appraisal name, description, and adding apprasials on different levels by adding new levels with descriptors and ratings.

activateAppraisalType - this use case activates an appraisal type for a specified period on a specific buzz space. This was not implemented.

Buzz-Notification
In the master specification it was specified that the Notifications module should have the following pre and post conditions. The post conditions were firstly, that a notification be sent out if buzz space has been created for module and the buzz space is open. Secondly, when a lecturer has been assignmed as space administrator and when a lecturer's profile has been created. Also, the root thread with the welcome post created for the buzz space. The pre conditions were that no buzz spaces exist for that module in the current year. Also, that a user is a lecturer in a specific module. 

Use cases
