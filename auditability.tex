\item Auditability:

The Buzz Space system is partially auditable, only the requests for the user serves of the system are logged. The logged request only contains:
\begin{itemize}
\item User serves requested.
\item Request object stringified as JSON
\end{itemize}

There are no log responses that are provided by the system, and the serves required to extract information from the audit logs is also not available not provided.
