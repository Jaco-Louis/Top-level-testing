Introduction

The testing phase of the mini project requires thorough testing of all the aspects of both systems developed. This includes both functional and non-functional aspect of the systems. The Buzz system aimed to assist users to collaborate and share knowledge with fellow students. The system was designed in order to create modules for the various functionality required, these modules needed to be integrated to create the desired system. Both systems were developed and needed to be tested. The testing of both systems will be discussed in the following sections.



Conclusion

The Buzz systems had been tested, evaluated and compared to the original specification that defined how the system should be implemented. The evaluation of both implementations have brought up several interesting facets. It has been noted that both systems function to an extent, but none of the two implementations fulfilled the requirements completely. The systems implemented showed some promise in terms of some modules when viewed in isolation, while some modules did not function completely. Some modules failed to satisfy testing requirements such as unit tests, while others excelled at their unit tests. The integration of several related modules led to great success while others failed. At the top level some implementations delivered a well-functioning system, but lacked in terms of security and completeness. The other implementation led to a well functioning interfaced system, but lacked in terms of functionality. The testing of both systems led to the conclusion that the systems both worked to some extent, but failed to satisfy the complete requirements of the original specification of the system.
