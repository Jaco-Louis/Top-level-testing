Security

The system needs to support:

Authentication against a chosen user repository: (initially against the LDAP repository of the Computer Science Department of the University of Pretoria).

The system is not secure. It does require a username and password in order for a user to login, but it does not allow take into account the level of authorisation users have. For example, anyone can create a new buzz space, constraint, or post without being logged in.





Auditability

The system does not support auditability. There is no log file or means of keeping record of the requests and who made them, and the responses to these requests.
