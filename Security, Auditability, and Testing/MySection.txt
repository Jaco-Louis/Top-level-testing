Security

The system needs to support:

Authentication against a chosen user repository: (initially against the LDAP repository of the Computer Science Department of the University of Pretoria).

The system requires a username and a password to perform authentication and to allow the user to log in. The system successfully performs authentication against the LDAP repository of the CS Department. 





Auditability

The system does not log any requests or responses.
